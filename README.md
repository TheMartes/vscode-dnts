A darker, calmer color theme is better for your eyes during the night. But it's not always convenient during the day. This extension allows you to define daytime and nighttime themes and quickly switch between them.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `dayNightThemeSwitcher.dayTheme`: day theme (default is "Visual Studio Light")
* `dayNightThemeSwitcher.nightTheme`: night theme (default is "Visual Studio Dark")
